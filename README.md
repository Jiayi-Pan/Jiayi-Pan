### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! I am a senior CS student at UMich/SJTU. My research goal to build language agents that operate in physical environments and interact with humans. Towards this goal, my current research focused on language grounding to vision and robotics.

For more about me, see you on [my homepage](https://jiayipan.me) :)
